# BYBN: A Tagalog to Baybayin Transcription Service
##### Created by Aesoji.

*BYBN is a transcription service that converts tagalog text in its latin form into Baybayin, an ancient pre-colonial writing system from the Philippines. The project is in accordance with the modern Baybayin rules (B17). This project makes it easier for developers, educators, and language enthusiasts to experiment with Baybayin without the need to navigate between different online services. This transcription service offers dual transcription services between both scripts and can specialize between Krus-Kudlit and Pamudpod. Your current transcription results can also be downlaoded as a text file (.txt) for future personal use. Enjoy!*

### Troubleshooting & FAQ
1. Why is the Baybayin to Tagalog transcription not as accurate?
   - The reason is because of the mapping and the Baybayin script itself. Baybayin letters do not distinguish between i/e and o/u which is why you lose some knowledge upon translating back into latin characters. However, fluent Tagalog speakers should not have problem reading the supposed word as the language itself is flexible with these vowel sounds, often having the word's meaning unchanged.
2. What is the difference between Krus-Kudlit and Pamudpod?
   - Krus-Kudlit is the offically recognized form of Baybayin (B17). Pamudpod is a variant that changes the killer accents' design to reflect more indigenous writings, seeing that the Krus-Kudlit is recognized as colonial influence.
